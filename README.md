                    auth_token='[AUTH_TOKEN]')

    # Get a list of all Links that you have created and display their slugs.
    response = api.links_list()
    for link in response['links']:
        print link['slug']

    # Create a new Link
    response = api.link_create(title='Hello, world!',
                               description='Well, hello again.',
                               base_price=0,
